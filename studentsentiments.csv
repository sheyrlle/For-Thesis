14,Low Confidence,Idk
14,High Confidence,Study hard and listen to your prof
15,Low Confidence,"As of now a little, because im in 2nd ye and we don't have a subject that the language is python so they still nothing to teach us that language but by watching in youtubes i still know a little in python"
15,Low Confidence,"Neutral, because since 1st yr we have thought about that languange and until now we study it"
15,Low Confidence,No so confident because i find it hard when it comes in sorting mostly in insertion
15,High Confidence,"Limited teaching of some profs though, i know that we need to self study but i prefer to teach me personally step by step so that i would know anything about it. "
15,High Confidence,Maybe if i not study hard enough
15,High Confidence,"Set camp or activities where student will focus in programming, learn and enhance their skills"

21,High Confidence,I'm so confident in using phyton since this language is most popular language so there's so many resources where I learned it.
21,High Confidence,I'm confident in using java since this language is the first language I master. It's also beginners friendly.
21,Low Confidence,I'm not that confident in using C because we don't dive deep into it
21,Low Confidence,When I mix the syntax because java and phyton have so different syntaxes. For example in java it uses curly braces and in phyton uses colon
21,Low Confidence,When I don't have confident in those language it's so hard to land a job because those programming languages are in demand
21,High Confidence,Best way to improve the confidence in learning programming languages is to keep grinding and don't think that you're the best in it. Because if you keep grinding you'll master it and you can use it flawlessly and if you think that you're the best on it you'll loose courage to go learn more
22,Low Confidence,I didn't tried it yet.
22,Low Confidence,I think I can do simple codes.
22,Low Confidence,I don't know if I can remember it.
22,Low Confidence,Not having personal laptop.
22,High Confidence,Learning these languages can open a lot of job opportunities. It will affect those opportunities and limit it.
22,High Confidence,"I think, the college should have different form of approach in teaching these specific languages. Should focus on two or just lesser programing languages that is really important."
23,Low Confidence,"If i were to rate my confidence in my skill in python programming out of 10, i would rate myself 6"
23,Low Confidence,I am not that confident when it comes to java programing let's say I'm about 5 out of 10
23,High Confidence,C programming is super similar to many programing languages so i would say i am a bit confident let's say 7 out of 10
23,Low Confidence,Talented peers and social standards
23,High Confidence,"It may or may not but Considering the goals i have, My confidence would not affect my future career "

25,High Confidence,A lot because that 3 programming language you mentioned is very in demand nowadays
25,High Confidence,Practice and focus on that programming languages because it might help you in the long run
26,Low Confidence,"Basic, I can only do python programming with basic coding. Not confident enough to be a python pro."
26,Low Confidence,"Basic as well, since it's a pure back end, and I can only manage some basic java programming."
26,Low Confidence,"Not sure though, but well I experience it first time and it's a bit complicated just for me... So it will be like below basic let's say trainee skill."
26,Low Confidence,"They are complicated language, but well they are as well short coding that can make function work without embedding with the code at the front end. Well it's not that hard to learn this but for me, I'm more like designing than this so I am not suitable of using these type of programming language, it makes me uncomfortable but the outcome is amazing."
26,High Confidence,"It will impact my job hunting, since python is more common programming language used in the western countries, and use for strict security improvement. So focusing on python is recommended for IT Students if they want to work especially in abroad."
26,High Confidence,"Maybe more fun activities related to these, ehheheheh, because the thing that amazed us students is its outcome, not the process. If fun activities are given to students that will output like for example use python to make star or pyramid using only ""*"". "
27,Low Confidence,"I'm not really confident since we haven't gotten to Python yet, but maybe through advanced study, I'll gain more confidence."
27,Low Confidence,"We haven’t reached Java yet, so I’m not confident, but maybe through advanced study, I’ll gain more confidence."
27,Low Confidence,"I'm not very confident because, for me, C is one of the most difficult programming languages, so I'm having a hard time learning it."
27,Low Confidence,"When I suddenly have to code without reviewing or practicing beforehand, that's when I tend to get lower scores."
27,High Confidence,"When looking for a job in the IT industry, skills are the most sought-after by companies, whether local or international."
27,High Confidence,"Honestly, just put in the effort. Learning programming isn't just about logic or critical thinking, it takes hard work and persistence too."

46,Low Confidence,"Not very confident, but i know the basics, self taught."
46,Low Confidence,"Different syntaxes, sometimes i mixed syntax of different prog-language"
46,Low Confidence,"Some in demand careers, uses the programming language im not very confident with. More likely hard to get jobs because of lack of deep knowledge of that prog-language"
46,High Confidence,"I suggest that, just keep learning. Watch random videos on yt about that programming language. And apply it create a simple program out of it"
47,High Confidence,"I am moderately confident in my Python programming skills. I can write basic programs and understand fundamental concepts, but I still have much to learn."
47,Low Confidence,"I have less confidence in my Java programming skills compared to Python. I understand the basics, but I haven't had as much practice."
47,Low Confidence,My confidence in C programming is low. I have limited experience with this language.
47,Low Confidence,The biggest challenge has been finding the time to practice consistently.  Balancing learning with other commitments has made it difficult to gain the fluency I would like.
47,High Confidence,My confidence level in these programming languages will directly influence the types of roles I can apply for and my success in interviews. Higher confidence will allow me to pursue more challenging opportunities
47,High Confidence,"To boost my confidence and learning, I would suggest creating a structured learning plan with dedicated practice time, focusing on consistent, smaller projects to build a portfolio, and actively seeking feedback from peers or mentors."

50,Low Confidence,"Same with Python, I only know the basics with it."
50,Low Confidence,The challenges I faced is that the professors only thought the basics about these languages. You have to self study for you to improve.
50,High Confidence,"Confidence with these languages is important since your job is related to what you are learning right now. If you are not confident and always rely to others while studying these languages, you probably will not suit any work related to computer and stuff in the future"
50,High Confidence,I suggest students to self study and don't get lazy studying these courses.
